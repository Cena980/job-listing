A responsive React component that displays a list of job openings with filtering functionality.

## Requirements:

### Implement client-side filters for:
* Department (e.g., Engineering, Design, Marketing)

* Location (e.g., Remote, New York, London)

* Job Type (Full-time, Contract)

* Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

. (Bonus) Implement a search function that filters jobs by title.

. (Bonus) Write a simple unit test for the filtering logic using Jest and React Testing Library.
